This repository contains a collection of plugins for the [FiftyOne](https://fiftyone.ai/), which make it easier than ever to connect your models to your data.

In particular, the plugins in this repository make the functionality from the FiftyOne SDK's [Hugging Face integration](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/huggingface.html) available directly within the FiftyOne App.

The plugins in this repository are:

- [`@voxel51/huggingface_hub`](./plugins/huggingface_hub): A plugin that allows you to push FiftyOne datasets to the Hugging Face Hub, and load datasets from the Hub into FiftyOne.
- [`@voxel51/transformers`](./plugins/transformers): A plugin that allows you to run inference on your datasets using Hugging Face Transformers models.
